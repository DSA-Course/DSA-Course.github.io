== Announcements
- Welcome to 22494 Convex Optimization, Spring semester 2020!
- This course was originally developed by [http://stanford.edu/~boyd/ Stephen P. Boyd]. We will use the same course text and many of the same course materials.
- Piazza's [http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~gmporter/post/2018/12/21/piazza-considered-harmful/ business model] [https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/opinion/children-privacy-online.html compromises your privacy]. In this course, we will use Quera instead. Sign up at [https://quera.ir/overview/add_to_course/course/4654 this link].
- All lectures and office hours during Week 3 are canceled due to the coronavirus outbreak and will be rescheduled for a later date.
- We will resume our class virtually amid novel coronavirus fears via [https://vc.sharif.edu/mtefagh webinar]. All TA session will be held via [https://vc.sharif.edu/t.mogtaba webinar] too.
- [courseinfo.html Office hours] have been updated to reflect new online office hours.
- [homework.html Homework 5] is posted. That finishes up the first round of assignments. There will be no lectures and homeworks on weeks 7 & 8 to observe the Nowruz holiday. Our class will resume on Sunday, April 5th. We recommend that you read sections of the book that you may have missed, or re-read sections that still confuse you during the break. We also recommend that you study the documentation for CVX*, skipping only the very driest sections. In particular, we expect you to know the [https://dcp.stanford.edu/ DCP] rules.
- Due to the ongoing situation relating to the COVID-19 coronavirus outbreak, the in-class midterm quiz has been canceled in the best interests of students and is replaced by a pair of [homework.html projects].
- [finals/2020-final.pdf Final exam] is posted. Good luck!
